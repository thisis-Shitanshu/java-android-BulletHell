# Bullet Hell
Game from the Old-West!

## Planning the project
- The game starts with Bob on the screen with a single bullet bouncing around the edges of the screen.
- The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible and the game will have a timer so the player knows how well they are doing.
- If Bob is about to get hit the player can tap anywhere on the screen and Bob will instantly teleport to that location.
    - However, each time Bob teleports, another bullet is spawned making the likelihood of collision.
        - And Bob needing to teleport again (and yet another bullet spawning), greater.
- Bob will have a 10-bullet shield.
